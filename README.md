# PPG_SLR_dataset

This repository is designed to host our dataset and analyzes for our paper “Biometric authentication using photoplethysmography (PPG): a twenty-year systematic literature review.”

We manually extracted the relevant parameters for each experiment in all studied articles.
We have gathered all this data into two CSV files which can be used to automatically analyze the data.

We also created two Jupyter notebooks to analyze the data with automatic procedures. The code can be run and all analyzes can be reproduced.

The Figures repository keeps track of all the images we have generated, even the one we did not keep in our article (for readability reasons or of little interest compared to the others).
